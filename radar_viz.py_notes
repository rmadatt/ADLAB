Description
The radar chart displays two datasets:

Sales (in green): Represents the performance metrics of the Sales department.
Marketing (in red): Represents the performance metrics of the Marketing department.
Each axis corresponds to one of the five categories, with values ranging from 0 to 10. The green and red lines outline the performance profiles, while the semi-transparent fill areas enhance visibility.
